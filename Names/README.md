# Windows

These are my functions for working with names.

All functions are stored in a separate .ps1 file.

With an standard example how to use them.

So almost all of the PowerShell files can be runned as they are.
If you just call them like on of the examples.

Format-Names.ps1
------------------
This function will format a name or names.
It will make the first letter to Upper and the rest to lower.

Tested with:
Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7+
