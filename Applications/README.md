# Applications

These are my functions for working with Applications.

All functions are stored in a separate .ps1 file.

With an standard example how to use them.

So almost all of the PowerShell files can be runned as they are.
If you just call them like on of the examples.

Get-ExeAppInformation.ps1
------------------
Gets Application information about a .exe file.
Supports ProductName, ProductVersion,CompanyName and Language.

Tested with:
Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7+
